# Test pixiv-cli

## Determine the evidence

Read the diff and the affected owner/tests before choosing commands. Work from the repository root unless a command explicitly needs another directory. Check `go version` against `go.mod`; source builds need cgo and a compatible C linker plus the committed native libraries. Do not install missing tools or fetch dependencies without authorization. Report environment failures separately from regressions.

For source behavior, select the smallest existing test that exposes the missing behavior, or extend it only where coverage is missing, and observe its expected failure before implementation. A test that fails to compile or cannot reach its assertion is not a behavioral Red. Implement one slice, run Green, then refactor and rerun. For structural-only work, reuse before/after characterization evidence; obtain an explicit exception if an applicable Red requirement cannot be met. Never modify expected output solely to make an unexplained failure disappear.

Use existing Go testing and HTTP/FS fixtures. Test public behavior through real boundaries rather than reproducing the implementation in mocks. Prefer deterministic inputs and temporary stores; exercise cancellation, error propagation, and ordering when affected. Follow the canonical [test file layout](../../../docs/en/maintainers/development.md#test-file-layout), including owner-matched names and documented same-package exceptions; do not create task-numbered test files or public exports only for tests.

## Decide whether test code must change

Before adding a test, name the observable contract or credible failure that existing tests do not protect. Inspect their assertions, not just their names or coverage percentage. Prefer running an existing test, then extending a relevant case/table, then adding a new test only for an uncovered scenario. Record the choice briefly in the existing handoff, not a new test-plan file.

- Test behavior, not the existence of each function or file. A getter, forwarding wrapper, simple field projection, or newly extracted helper needs no separate test when its behavior is already protected at the calling boundary. Short security, parsing, or persistence code can still carry independent risk and require coverage.
- For pure moves, renames, or extraction, run existing characterization before and after. Do not invent a behavior change, alter an assertion to manufacture Red, or duplicate a test solely because a helper appeared.
- Test at the narrowest stable boundary that catches the defect. Extra CLI/MCP/SDK layers earn tests for distinct serialization, validation, permissions, or failure semantics, not repeated assertions of the same mapping. Mock real external boundaries rather than recreating the implementation in a test.
- Keep fixtures and assertions direct. Use table-driven cases only when they share setup and semantics; avoid a generic fixture builder, mock hierarchy, assertion DSL, or new framework for a small case. Do not test standard-library behavior instead of the project's own contract.
- Ordinary prose comments, headings, and internal code layout do not need exact-text or AST/regex tests. Machine-consumed directives, generated contracts, parsers, and security boundaries may need targeted existing checks; distinguish those from style preferences.
- Remove or consolidate tests only within the authorized scope and after identifying the same contract protected by retained checks. Preserve regression inputs and run the retained checks; fewer lines alone do not justify deleting evidence.

Finish adding tests when changed contracts and credible failure paths are protected. There is no per-function, per-file, test-count, or invented coverage-percentage target. TDD governs the order of evidence, not the quantity of new test code; mandatory repository gates still apply.

## Select checks

Start with the affected package and named test, for example `go test ./path/to/owner -run '^TestName$' -count=1`, replacing both placeholders with inspected values. Then expand according to actual impact:

| Change | Relevant checks |
| --- | --- |
| Documentation, instructions, product skills | Inspect links, skill metadata, examples, and `git diff --check`; run affected existing script/tool contracts |
| Local Go implementation | Focused test, affected integration packages, and scoped `go vet`; run `sh scripts/build.sh` when the change affects the build or executable |
| Shared contract, public SDK, core behavior, or release candidate | `go test ./... -count=1`, `go vet ./...`, and `sh scripts/build.sh`, in addition to focused regression |
| Concurrency, account lifecycle, persistence, shared runtime | Add `go test -race ./... -count=1`; use native platform checks where platform code is involved |
| Workflow, workflow-contract test, or CI documentation | `go test ./scripts/tests/... ./scripts/internal/... -count=1`; the workflow YAML is the source of truth for its own ordering and permissions |
| Platform/release contracts | `go test ./tools/release ./tools/platformmatrix -count=1`, affected `scripts/...` tests, and the relevant build/package/Homebrew fixture scripts |
| Rust/cgo/staticlib or ABI | Follow [pixiv-cli-native](../pixiv-cli-native/SKILL.md), not an unrelated Go-only substitute |

Use `gofmt -l` on affected Go files and the existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml`. Run installed pre-commit when applicable; do not introduce a new linter or download hook environments silently. `sh -n` checks shell syntax, not shell behavior. Cross-compilation checks compilation, not execution on another operating system.

`ci.yml` runs the full `Quality gate` on every pull request with no per-path skip, so this table selects what *you* run locally rather than predicting which CI jobs will be skipped. This fork carries no change-scope classifier, no PR-smoke coordinator, and no `/test` command. `platform-smoke.yml`, `container-smoke.yml`, and `browser-evidence.yml` only run when a maintainer dispatches them; ordinary branch/main pushes run no CI, and matching tags retain the current Release path.

## Live and native boundaries

The ordinary suite must remain offline-stable. Real SDK E2E is opt-in and can rotate/persist credentials. Read the live-test section of `docs/en/maintainers/development.md` and obtain account/target authorization first. Select an authorized secondary Pixiv account with `PIXIV_E2E_READ_USER_ID`; never read a real credential store into the transcript. FANBOX sessions come from the agreed Keychain environment, not command arguments or logs.

`TestRealPixivSDKRead` and `TestRealFanboxSDKRead` prove their specific live paths only when actually run. The FANBOX full read requires a first-party attachment; `TestRealFanboxSDKPostInfo` is supplemental partial evidence, not a replacement. Default skips are not live evidence. Reverse-search E2E additionally needs explicit image-upload authorization. An upstream 429 is not permission to invent retries or rotate accounts.

Native/browser fixture checks do not establish real keychain/DPAPI access, and one host does not establish native linking on every shipped platform. Select the existing native/browser evidence workflows for those claims. Preserve the documented Windows ARM64 race-detector limitation and its exact diagnostic check; do not call unsupported execution a successful race run.

## Handle failures and finish

Identify the first causal failure, command, owner, and relevant environment. For a fail-fast gate, run relevant safely independent downstream checks to expose other blockers. Do not repeatedly run unchanged deterministic failures; retry only after a relevant change or to test a stated infrastructure/flakiness hypothesis. Fix only in-scope regressions.

Report actual commands, pass/fail/skip, unrun checks and why, tested commit, and remaining risk. Completion requires the requested behavior and mandatory evidence, not a selected subset of green checks.
